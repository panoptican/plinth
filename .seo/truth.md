# Source of truth

Derived from the repo. This is what fact-check prompts are scored against.
Re-derive whenever pricing, plans or integrations change. A stale truth file turns
correct answers into false accuracy failures and wastes a whole cycle.

| Claim | Value | Source | Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site type | Static literary journal archive | `README.md` | 2026-09-11 |
| Issue count | Seven issues | `README.md`; `src/issue01/` through `src/issue07/` | 2026-09-11 |
| Archive span | 2013–2017 | `README.md` | 2026-09-11 |
| Production URL | https://plinth.us | `README.md` | 2026-09-11 |
| Positioning phrase | “PLINTH collects & manifests an alternate canon” | `src/index.html` | 2026-09-11 |

## Integrations

Include the negatives. "We do not integrate with X" is the claim an engine is most
likely to get wrong in the flattering direction, and a flattering wrong answer costs
you the deal at the demo instead of at the search.

| Integration | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| External integrations | none identified | Static HTML repository; verify before making a claim | 2026-09-11 |

## Contradictions found

Where the code and the marketing site disagree. Each of these is already a finding:
if your own surfaces contradict each other, an engine synthesizing both produces a muddle.

| Claim | Code says | Site says | Which is right |
